# TierMaker2 🎯

This is really just TierMaker but with additional user-friendly features that the first lacks.

## ✨ Features

- **Exact TierMaker Interface**: Pixel-perfect recreation of the original TierMaker design
- **Dark Theme**: Modern dark UI with TierMaker's signature pink accent color
- **Drag & Drop**: Full drag-and-drop functionality for creating tier lists
- **Template Management**: Create, edit, delete, and duplicate templates
- **Public Sharing**: Share your templates publicly via GitHub integration
- **Responsive Design**: Works perfectly on desktop and mobile devices
- **GitHub Pages Ready**: Fully static site that works on GitHub Pages

## 🔧 GitHub Integration Setup

To enable public template sharing, you'll need to create a GitHub Personal Access Token:

### Step 1: Create Personal Access Token
1. Go to [GitHub Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
2. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Give it a descriptive name like "TierMaker2 Template Sharing"
4. Select the `public_repo` scope
5. Click "Generate token"
6. **Copy the token** 

## ⚡ Fully Automatic Public Publishing

Public templates can now publish automatically without manual commits from you:

- If the publisher has write access to `FreePirat/Tiermaker2`, the template is committed directly to `main` immediately.
- If they do not have write access, a PR is created automatically and GitHub Actions auto-merges template-only PRs.

Workflow file: `.github/workflows/auto-publish-and-email.yml`

## 📧 Email Notification on New Publish

When any `templates/*.json` file is pushed to `main`, GitHub Actions sends an email notification.

Set these repository secrets in **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**:

- `SMTP_HOST` (example: `smtp.gmail.com`)
- `SMTP_PORT` (example: `587`)
- `SMTP_USERNAME` (sender email address)
- `SMTP_PASSWORD` (app password / SMTP password)
- `EMAIL_TO` (set to `jakennik01@gmail.com`)

Notes:

- For Gmail, use an App Password (not your normal account password).
- If secrets are missing, publish still works, but email step fails until configured.

- ✅ Pure client-side code (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- ✅ No server-side dependencies
- ✅ Uses localStorage for local data persistence
- ✅ Uses GitHub API for public template sharing
- ✅ Graceful error handling for storage limitations

## 🔒 Privacy & Data

- **Local Templates**: Stored in your browser's localStorage

- **Images**: Embedded as base64 data URLs (no external hosting needed)
- **Authentication**: Uses GitHub Personal Access Tokens (stored locally)
